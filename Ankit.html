            <h3>Parents</h3>
            <p> My father, Gopi Khadka, was a teacher.
                My mother, Maiya Rawal, is a housewife. Both of my parents are originally from
                Dhading. </p>

            <h3>Ancestors</h3>
            <p>My parents are from dhading.We have roots in Dhading, and even though we may not know much about our
                ancestors, their traditions are an important part of our family story.</p>

            <h3>Birthplace</h3>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhading_District">Dhading</a> is where I was born
                in Nepal. It has big mountains, like Ganesh Himal. The road to Kathmandu, called Prithivi Highway, goes
                through Dhading. People there mostly farm, and there are rivers like Budi Gandaki. Dhading has different
                weather, from hot to cold. Many families there are a mix of Brahmin, Chhetri, Tamang, Gurung, and
                Newari. It's a special place with its own culture and traditions. I grew up surrounded by nature in
                Dhading..</p>

        <div id="places-lived">
            <h3>Places Lived</h3>
            <p>I lived in Dhading, Nepal, for a long time, then Bhaktapur for a bit, and later in Kathmandu. Now, I'm in
                Canada for three months. Bhaktapur is a small, famous city in Nepal known for its tradition and food. It
                got hurt in the 2015 earthquake. Bhaktapur has an old, interesting history from a really long time ago.
                The people there mainly follow Hinduism and have cool festivals. UNESCO calls Bhaktapur a special place
                because of its old buildings and culture.</p>
